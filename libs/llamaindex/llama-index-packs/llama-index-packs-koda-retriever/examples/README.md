# Notebooks as a guide

For now, the following guides exist:

- [Alpha Tuning](alpha_tuning.ipynb): Showcases a (simple) example on how to provide custom categories/alpha values for alpha tuning.
- [Quickstart](quickstart.ipynb): A quickstart notebook showing how Koda Retriever functions with default values and basic fixtures.

Both are recommended to review. More notebooks will be added as this project grows.
