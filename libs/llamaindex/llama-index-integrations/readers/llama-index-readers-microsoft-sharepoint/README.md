## Usage

To use this loader `client_id`, `client_secret` and `tenant_id` of the registered app in Microsoft Azure Portal is required.

This loader loads the files present in a specific folder in sharepoint.

If the files are present in the `Test` folder in SharePoint Site under `root` directory, then the input for the loader for `file_path` is `Test`

```python
from llama_index.readers.microsoft_sharepoint import SharePointReader

loader = SharePointReader(
    client_id="<Client ID of the app>",
    client_secret="<Client Secret of the app>",
    tenant_id="<Tenant ID of the Microsoft Azure Directory>",
)

documents = loader.load_data(
    sharepoint_site_name="<Sharepoint Site Name>",
    sharepoint_folder_path="<Folder Path>",
    recursive=True,
)
```

The loader doesn't access other components of the `SharePoint Site`.
